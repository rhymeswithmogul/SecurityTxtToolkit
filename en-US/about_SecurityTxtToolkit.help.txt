SHORT DESCRIPTION
    SecurityTxtToolkit is a module that works with "security.txt" files.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    SecurityTxtToolkit is a PowerShell module.   It can create, download, test,
    and verify "security.txt" files.  Standardized as RFC 9116, this allows web
    sites post and share information pertinent to security researchers.

TESTING "SECURITY.TXT" FILES WITH TEST-SECURITYTXTFILE
    To test a "security.txt" file, use the cmdlet Test-SecurityTxtFile.  It can
    be used in both online and offline modes.  It outputs a PSCustomObject that
    has note-properties corresponding to the fields in the "security.txt" file.
    
    There are other properties, including IsValid and IsCanonical, which aren't
    part of the "security.txt" specification, but may help with your scripting.
    If "security.txt" is directly fetched by the cmdlet, then canonicity checks
    are done; however, if you test an offline file or pipeline input, you can't
    test for canonicity.  Thus, this cmdlet has a parameter, -TestCanonicalUri,
    that can be used to verify that the given URI is present in the "Canonical"
    fields.

GENERATING YOUR OWN "SECURITY.TXT" FILES
    The New-SecurityTxtFile cmdlet will generate a "security.txt" file, sending
    its output to the pipeline. You may redirect it via standard means, or with
    the -OutFile parameter.   The fields in the "security.txt" specification do
    correspond to this cmdlet's parameters.

EXAMPLES
    1. TESTING AN ACTIVE SERVER

    Testing an online "security.txt" file is simple:
        PS C:\> Test-SecurityTxtFile 'github.com'
    
    As of this writing (June 2021), that will generate the following output:

        Test-SecurityTxtFile: The mandatory Expires field was not found.

        For                : github.com
        IsValid            : False
        IsCanonical        : True
        Acknowledgements   : {https://bounty.github.com/bounty-hunters.html}
        Canonical          : {https://github.com/.well-known/security.txt}
        Contact            : {https://hackerone.com/github}
        Encryption         : {}
        Expires            :
        Hiring             : {}
        Policy             : {https://bounty.github.com/}
        PreferredLanguages : {en}
        IsSigned           : False
        IsSignedBy         : {}
        HasGoodSignature   : False
    
    It looks like GitHub's "security.txt" file is not compliant with the latest
    version of the draft specification!


    2. TESTING A DOWNLOADED OR GENERATED FILE
    
    The Test-SecurityTxtFile cmdlet also accepts string input via -InputObject. 
    The cmdlet runs identically whether its input come down the pipeline, or it
    be specified as a parameter.

    In this example, assume the user has downloaded a web site's "security.txt"
    file to their computer:
        PS C:\> Get-Content "security.txt" | Test-SecurityTxtFile

    That will test the file and validate its input:
        For                : stdin
        IsValid            : False
        IsCanonical        : False
        Acknowledgements   : {https://bounty.github.com/bounty-hunters.html}
        Canonical          : {https://github.com/.well-known/security.txt}
        Contact            : {https://hackerone.com/github}
        Encryption         : {}
        Expires            :
        Hiring             : {}
        Policy             : {https://bounty.github.com/}
        PreferredLanguages : {en}
        IsSigned           : False
        IsSignedBy         : {}
        HasGoodSignature   : False

    However, that cannot be validated for canonicity. In this case, you can add
    the file's original URL to the cmdlet with the -TestCanonicalUri parameter:
        PS C:\> Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile 'security.txt' -Uri `
        >> 'https://github.com/.well-known/security.txt'

        PS C:\> Get-Content 'security.txt' | Test-SecurityTxtFile `
        >> -TestCanonicalUri 'https://github.com/.well-known/security.txt'

    The latter command will parse the previously-downloaded "security.txt" file
    as if it had been fetched directly from a web server. Do note "IsCanonical"
    has changed values now that the parameter has been specified.

        For                : stdin
        IsValid            : False
        IsCanonical        : True
        Acknowledgements   : {https://bounty.github.com/bounty-hunters.html}
        Canonical          : {https://github.com/.well-known/security.txt}
        Contact            : {https://hackerone.com/github}
        Encryption         : {}
        Expires            :
        Hiring             : {}
        Policy             : {https://bounty.github.com/}
        PreferredLanguages : {en}
        IsSigned           : False
        IsSignedBy         : {}
        HasGoodSignature   : False


    3. GENERATING YOUR OWN "SECURITY.TXT" FILE

    Here's how to generate a "security.txt" file:
        PS C:\> New-SecurityTxtFile -OutFile '.well-known/security.txt' `
        >> -Canonical "https://contoso.com/.well-known/security.txt" `
        >> -Contact "mailto:security@contoso.com" `
        >> -Hiring "https://jobs.contoso.com"
    
    That example will genereate the following output. The Expires field and PGP
    signature will vary:
        -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
        Hash: SHA256

        # This is a "security.txt" file that complies with draft-foudil-securitytxt-12:
        # <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-12>
        #
        # This file was made with SecurityTxtToolkit:
        # <https://github.com/rhymeswithmogul/SecurityTxtToolkit>

        Canonical: https://contoso.com/.well-known/security.txt
        Contact: mailto:security@contoso.com
        Expires: 2022-06-18T16:41:06-04:00
        Hiring: https://jobs.contoso.com/

        -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

NOTE
    If you have GnuPG installed, two more things will happen:
      1. The New-SecurityTxtFile will attempt to clear-sign the generated file.
      2. The Test-SecurityTxtFile will attempt to verify the signature.

    Installing that and creating a PGP keypair and/or keychain is beyond the
    scope of this contextual help and left as an exercise for the PowerSheller.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    This module complies with RFC 9116.
